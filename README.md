# External Sorting

## General information
This program implements the external sorting methods in order to sort a set of records stored in an external file. In this case, the external file contains the database of records, each of which is a 2-dimensional vector.
The database needs to be sorted by comparing the length of vectors.

## Input data

### File

#### File format

Input files should be binary files, containing the database. Each record should be the pair of two 4-bytes integers. The file has to be ordered in little endian. The file should not be prepared by user, but generated by the program itself.
